Look! AN ACTUAL EASTER EGG (I *never* find these things)! While everyone's busy with snowmen and reindeer, this little egg is just *vibing* by a tree like it's not the complete wrong season. Nothing says 'North Pole winter wonderland' quite like an Easter egg. Sure, why not! 🥚

Meanwhile, Frosty's malicious gnomes are probably hopping around, completely confused. "Is that... no, it can't be. We're months away from that." But there it sits, *defiant* in its pastel glory, absolutely zero concern for seasonal appropriateness or evil winter plots.

One might even say this egg could be the *most villainous* character in the entire story... the total disregard... the unflinching, unwavering dedication to seasonal chaos. Forget freezing the neighborhood, this egg is out here breaking the entire holiday calendar!

Until next year...
